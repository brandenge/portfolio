      "description": "I am a software engineer with a passion for building robust software, creating amazing user experiences, and having a high impact in the areas of entrepreneurship, automation, education, writing, and games. I acquired these passions with a diverse background as a Marine Corps veteran and work experience in a variety of roles at the intersection of business and technology. This has given me a well-rounded foundation in understanding people, teams, and business. But through my diverse experiences I learned that I can have the greatest impact in all of these areas as a software engineer. Ever since I have fallen in love with engineering, I have dedicated my life to writing clean code and pursuing a life-long journey of continuously learning and improving as a programmer. I am a curious and ambitious learner in a wide range of fields, including web development, networking, cloud computing, DevOps, databases, and game development. I am hungry for constructive feedback, and am a leader in creating positive team dynamics that promote grit and a growth mindset in myself and others. In the future, I will dedicate my passions towards building my own companies. But until then, I look forward to dedicating those passions towards continuing to build an already great company with a great team today.",

All data is saved in a single nested data structure which is an array of obects that represent to-do lists, which further contain an array of tasks within each to-do list object. This object is saved on the user's computer locally using the Storage API in the browser (using localStorage methods). This serves as a simple database so that the data persists across sessions and page refreshes without the use of a separate traditional database.",
